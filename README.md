How To Play

On your turn, you can move orthogonally the number of spaces on your square.
You must move the full number of squares.
You may not move to an occupied square or the square you were on the previous turn.
After moving, you increment or decrement the number in any unoccupied square.
If it's your turn and you have no legal moves, you lose.
